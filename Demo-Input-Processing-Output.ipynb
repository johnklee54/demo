A function is a piece of prewritten code designed to perform a specific operation. Python has many functions built into it for us to use. One of the most often used functions is print(). Print() displays output to the screen. To use a function in Python, just simply call (type) the function in the code and place any arguments the function needs in between (). In the code sample below, the print() function is called with \"Hi, it is me\" as the argument to print. There are many options for the print() function, but for now just remember it is used to send output to the screen.","metadata":{},"id":"2c49c38a"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print (\"Hi, it is me\")","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"7801e3f2"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Now it is your turn\n\nTry and see if you can modify the code below and get the program to ask for both the hours worked and the hourly rate.

A book definition of a variable is **\"A variable is a name that represents a storage location in the computer's memory.\"**\nA simplier way to illustrate what a variable is may be equating it to a placeholder in a program. The placeholder will represent a value for the program and is considered input to program. In the original program above, there were two variables. **hours** and **hourly_rate**. The act of placing data into a variable is called assigning a value to a variable. If you recall, the variable hours requested the user to input a value for hours worked, while 15 was inserted into hourly_rate within the program. There are different ways to assign data to a variable and we will see a few more along the way. <br/>\n#### Reference Vs. Hold\nQuick note to explain a variable in Python. Variables exists in all programming languages. In most programming languages when we assign a value to a varible, it is stored in the varaible's memory location. In Python, a variable's memory location holds a memory address of another location. When a value is assigned to a variable in Python, the value is held in a different location and the varaible will hold the address to the location of the value. That is why in Python we do not say a variable \"holds\" a value, instead we say a variable \"references\" a value. \n\n### How do we choose the name of a variable?\nA varaible can really be any name we want, but there are some rules we have to follow in Python when naming variables\n\n- A variable name cannot contain spaces\n- A variable name cannot be one of Python's keywords. \n- The first character of a variable name must be a letter or and underscore _\n- After the first character, letters, numbers 0-9 or underscores are all valid\n- Finally Uppercase and Lowercase are distinct. This simply means Hours and hours are two separate variable names\n\nIt is generally a good idea to name a variable something which indicates it's purpose. Our program example above used hours to reference hours worked and hourly_rate to reference the amount of money a person is paid per hour. We could have easily used  x and y to reference the same , but x and y do not give us an indication of what the variable will reference. <br/>\nIn the code below I want to print the answer to 12 \\* 12 \\* 34\\*12 \\* (12-6) + 12.
